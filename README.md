Project carried out by Rocketseat in its NLW bootcamp, specifically in the Discover mission.
This project was developed as an application where it creates virtual rooms that can receive questions for its owner, and there it is possible to answer, delete or mark them as read.
The focus of this project was trying to implement a database with SQLite using express through NodeJS, to save the questions, room passwords and the room codes

Used tools:
- HTML, CSS e JS
- NodeJS, Express, EJS
